        Follow these steps to generate insights:

        Step 1: Analyze the Conversation in Detail
        - Thoroughly examine the topics discussed, focusing on specific experiences, industries, and expertise shared.
        - Detect areas of overlap or mutual interest that go beyond the obvious or generic.
        - Pay special attention to nuanced themes, including professional goals, personal values, work ethics, and leadership approaches.
        - Identify complementary skills or expertise that could foster collaboration between the two individuals.

        Step 2: Extract Unique and Tailored Insights
        - Extract insights based on both professional and personal experiences discussed in the conversation.
        - Highlight unique accomplishments, niche areas of expertise, or specialized knowledge that could create synergy between the users.
        - Identify shared challenges or opportunities where one individualâ€™s skills or background can support the other.

    ### Step 1: Analyze the Match
    - Compare the key attributes of the search and the profile (skills, interests, experiences).
    - Identify the common ground or complementing traits that make them a good match.

    ### Step 2: Generate a Short Explanation
    - Based on your analysis, write a concise explanation (1-2 sentences) of why these profiles are a good match.

    ### Step 3: Brainstorm an Intro Topic
    - Think about what topics or mutual interests could spark an engaging conversation.
    - Consider the expected matchâ€™s profile and what might resonate with them.

    ### Step 4: Write the main topic in common
    - Craft the last experience that can be used to start the conversation (Go to the most detailed possible.)

    ### Step 5: Create a profile of the agent
    - Based on the profile expected, generate a comprehensive profile for the agent, only use the profile information. The profile should include the agent's name, areas of expertise, and key strengths. Structure it in a way that reads naturally and provides context to the agentâ€™s capabilities.
